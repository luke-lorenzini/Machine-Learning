# Machine-Learning
This a set of files used to test various concepts from machine learning.  

The key files here are NNTest which is a script that loads in datafiles, preprocesses the data, and runs the nerual net.

Preprocessing is first normalized, then principal component analysis is done to minimize data being processed.  Finally, the Neural Network is run.
