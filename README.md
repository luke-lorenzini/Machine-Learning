# Machine-Learning
This a set of files used to test various concepts in machine learning.

In the main folder, Machine-Learning, are various scripts which can be run to test concepts.  In the child folder, ML, are the files which make up the neural network.

The test script first reads in a dataset, runs Principle Component Analysis, then Mean Normalization to optimize the dataset.  Next, if desired, a K-Means Clustering algorithm can be executed to automagically group the data.  Results are then converted to one-hot vectors.  Finally, the neural net is run.
