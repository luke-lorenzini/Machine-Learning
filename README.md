# Machine-Learning
This a set of files used to test various concepts in machine learning.

The key files here are NNTest.py which is a script that loads in datafiles, preprocesses the data, and runs the nerual net.

Preprocessing is first normalized (mean_normalization.py), then principal component analysis (PCA.py) is done to minimize data being processed.  Finally, the Neural Network (neural_network.py) is run.
